I am an automotive test lab engineer in Sindelfingen and have been working on dyno automation and networking since end of 2014.

Computers have always been fascinating me. I like to do hobby projects with microcontrollers, [small ARM-devices with Linux][2] and FPGAs. Here and there I also contribute to several open-source software projects.

Apart from that I am very interested in motor-vehicles, be it old vintage cars or modern passenger vehicles/trucks. It fascinates me how lots of different areas of science come together within such a product and how scientific advancements and governmental regulations have steadily influenced their quality and efficiency.

Also, I am very interested in low-cost home-brew prototyping, such as 3D-printing, PCB milling/development. Some of the hobby projects I do are used for home-automation or [multimedia applications][3].
