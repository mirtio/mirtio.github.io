title: About
---

I am a research fellow at the [Institute for System Dynamics][1] working on their automotive team. In my PhD I am working in the field of numerical optimization and control theory, with driver assistence systems in hybrid-electric commercial vehicles being the target applications.

Computers have always been fascinating me. I like to do hobby projects with microcontrollers, [small ARM-devices with Linux][2] and FPGAs. Here and there I also contribute to several open-source software projects. 

Also, I am very interested in low-cost home-brew prototyping, such as 3D-printing, PCB milling/development. Some of the hobby projects I do are used for home-automation or [multimedia applications][3].
